# Governance

## Overview 

The work of the [Open Project name] community is governed by this document, in accordance with [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/). The purpose of this document is to describe how the community works together to achieve its technical goals.

The [Open Project name] works as much as possible by lazy consensus, especially within each Technical Steering Committee (TSC), as described under [Decision Making](#decision-making) below.  Each TSC is responsible for determining when it has lazy consensus, guided by the principal that those who show up and do the work get to make the decisions.

The Project Governing Board (PGB) works by lazy consensus as much as possible, however, because of its role in project governance, there are specific steps that require a formal vote. These are described in the Open Projects Process. 

## Community Roles and Leadership

All members of the community must abide by all relevant policies including the [OASIS Open Projects Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct can have consequences including being held no longer eligible to participate in the work.

* *Contributors*: People who have contributed to a project repository are contributors. Anyone can be a contributor, so long as they sign the appropriate Contributor License Agreements and conform to the Open Project policies. [add appropriate link]

* *Technical Steering Committee (TSC)*: Contributors can be invited by the PGB to join the TSC. A TSC generally covers the work on a single project within the Open Project. The TSC has day-to-day oversight of the technical work on the project and works with project maintainers to make sure project's goals are met. The TSC also advises the PGB on the technical agenda such as when works are ready for approval and release. The PGB must publish process documentation outlining the requirements for joining and voting in the projectâ€™s TSC.

TSC members must have submitted an individual CLA, and if representing an organization, that organization must have signed and submitted an entity CLA as well.

Each TSC has a chair or two co-chairs appointed by the PGB. The chair of a TSC is responsible for coordinating the committee's meetings, reviews, etc. The chair(s) should have a firm understanding of the technology under the TSC's purview, and the [skills of a Technical Project Manager](https://www.jobhero.com/technical-program-manager-job-description/).

* *Project Governing Board (PGB)*: The PGB oversees the overall strategy and direction of the project as well as the work of the TSCs. The PGB has final approval via Special Majority Vote of project releases and Project Specifications and their submission to the members of OASIS as candidates for OASIS Standard.  

The **PGB** also follows and is responsible for upholding the [OASIS Open Projects Rules](url to op rules).

The PGB is comprised of one representative from each Sponsoring organization, and a representative from each TSC (generally the chair). The PGB may create additional PGB member seats for expert representatives to be elected by the TSC or appointed by the PGB.

* *Editors*: Editors are appointed (or removed) by the relevant TSC. Any Contributor is eligible to be an Editor.

Editors are expected to be actively involved in discussion of Proposals and helping them reach the quality level required to reach Candidate stage, and more generally to actively maintain the overall quality of their TSC's specification(s).

As defined in [Decision Making](#Decision-Making), Editors are empowered to interpret the "Lazy Consensus" of a TSC, subject to direction from the chairs to implement a formally declared decision.

## Decision Making

Everyday TSC decisions will be reached by [lazy consensus](https://communitymgt.fandom.com/wiki/Lazy_consensus). Editors are empowered to implement the consensus of a TSC as they see it. The TSC chair is empowered to direct the Editor(s) to make a change reflecting a decision of the TSC.

If the chairs of a TSC determine that consensus is not possible, then the TSC will not publish any output. 

Any TSC lazy consensus decision can be overturned by a 2/3 majority vote of the PGB at the request of a TSC contributor. However, the PGB is not required to take up the request.

The PGB is unlikely to overturn a decision based on a single objection from a contributor who has barely participated, or an apparent "[branch-stacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_stacking)" (aka Room Packing) exercise. 

Lazy consensus does not apply to certain decisions of the **PGB**, as defined elsewhere in this document.

## Lazy Consensus

Out of respect for other contributors, major changes should also be accompanied by a post on an email list or bulletin board (i.e., the OASIS-provided mailing list for each TSC) as appropriate. Author(s) of proposal, Pull Requests, issues, etc. will give a time period of no less than seven (7) working days for comment and remain cognizant of popular observed world holidays.

Other maintainers may chime in and request additional time for review, but should remain cognizant of blocking progress and abstain from delaying progress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress is accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action(s) (proposals, PRs, issues, etc.) in short order.

Lazy Consensus is practiced for all projects in our org, including the main project repository, community-driven sub-projects, and the community repo that includes proposals and governing documents.

Lazy consensus does _not_ apply to some PGB decisions identified elsewhere in this document, such as:
* Appointing or Removing TSC chairs or PGB Members
* Removing TSC Members, other than for failure to abide by the formal legal obligations described below
* Moving a specification to the OASIS standards track
